about=The Qgis plugin allows to build a "on field" mobile survey in minutes starting from a Qgis layer and get back collected data with the help of Open Data Kit tools and services. Open Data Kit (ODK) https://opendatakit.org/ is a free and open-source set of tools which help to manage mobile data collection solutions.
  The typical ODK collection workflow is based on the following activities:
  - survey form design (XlsForm/XForm)
  - deployment of survey forms on ODK collect Android App
  - on field data collection by a mobile device
  - data aggregation on server
